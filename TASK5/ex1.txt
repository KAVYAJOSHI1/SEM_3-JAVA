Processing is the process of using computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Latest topics in digital image processing for research and thesis are based on these algorithms. Being a subcategory of digital signal processing, digital image processing is better and carries many advantages over analog image processing. It permits to apply multiple algorithms to the input data and does not cause the problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion while processing.
