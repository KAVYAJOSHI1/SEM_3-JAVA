# Java Programs - Semester 3 Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java programs created during Semester 3. These programs demonstrate various **Core Java** concepts, including **exception handling**, **multithreading**, **file handling**, **algorithms**, and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Each program focuses on different aspects of Java, providing a comprehensive view of fundamental Java topics.

## Folders

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **Exceptions**
Contains programs related to Java **exception handling**. These programs demonstrate the use of `try`, `catch`, `throw`, and custom exceptions.

For more about exception handling, refer to the official [Java Exception Handling Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/).

### 2. **GLS**
This folder contains programs related to **GLS (Generic Learning System)** concepts or practice programs. Specific details about the content will be elaborated within the individual files.

### 3. **TASKs**
Includes TASK 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which likely represent assignment-specific implementations or examples. The specific topics covered in each task can be accessed through the respective program files.

### 4. **Constructor and Function Overloading**
This folder contains programs demonstrating the usage of **constructors** and **function/method overloading** in Java. These features are part of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, which allow multiple methods or constructors to share the same name with different parameters.

For a detailed explanation of constructors, visit the [Java Constructor Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-java/).

For more on function overloading, refer to the [Function Overloading in Java](https://www.journaldev.com/1693/java-method-overloading).

### 5. **Individual Java Programs**
Below is a list of individual Java programs and their purpose:
